# Planets Facts
Planets Facts app is based on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) challenge design. This project was a great opportunity to train React and Typescript skills. What's more, thanks to this project I've learned how to use Framer Motion library which is awesome tool to make animation in React.
